# Todo App

This Todo application was built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like adding, updating, and deleting todos. The application follows best practices for React development and includes error handling for a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **React & TypeScript**: Utilized React for building the user interface and TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.
- **API Interaction**: Includes a custom `fetchClient.ts` for handling HTTP requests to a backend API.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages for various error scenarios.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for todos.
- **Semantic UI**: Implements semantic HTML and CSS classes for better accessibility and styling.
